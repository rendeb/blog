For the sake of privacy, I probably won't expose my name here, but you can call me **rendeb**. Rust and C are my tools, even though Javascript is taking over the desktop & mobile world with PWAs and Electron. JS is like that girl from math class that has no idea what she's doing, she just looks cute.
