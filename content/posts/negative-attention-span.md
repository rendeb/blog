It's eight o'clock and I've spent the majority of my time after work doing nothing. I guess the same could be said if I was playing video games like I've done in the past. Another flaw in my system is attention, I mean I really struggle to focus now-days. I get so upset with myself over it too, it's quite pathetic. I can spend hours fucking-off, looking at amazon or eBay for computer parts, but I can't stay focused reading a programming book for longer than an hour. I've done some pretty desperate things like:
- sold my pc to keep myself from gaming
- installed *nix on my pc to keep from gaming on windows
- unplugged the router
- bought an overly-expensive aluminum fruit to help me focus and be motivated about programming

I know it kind of looks like I have a gaming addiction and I did, but not so much anymore. I work too often now, so I don't really have the time to hammer out a 12 hour sweat-inducing gaming session. One of the things I'm considering is re-formatting my computer so that everything will be clean and neat...so that it'll be easier to focus right? Wrong. It never works. I've probably spent more time installing operating systems than an early 2000's NOC engineer in his first 4 years; sadly. 

God, I really wish I had put some effort into my high school math classes too, because it's so hard to even grasp algorithms in programming. Especially if you read some academia paper that shows nothing, but formula and convoluted English. No, but seriously data structures and algorithms is where my brain starts to say "Ok, look man. You didn't even pass pre-algebra, y-- what's a quadratic equation?" Big oof. ðŸ˜“ Maybe one day I'll find a book that'll learn me some maths.

There was one thing I was at least decent at (not anymore) in high school; English. What the hell is English even good for if all I need are a few keywords in programming? Please don't tell me I'd be good at documentation, even programmers hate writing their own documentation ðŸ˜ž
