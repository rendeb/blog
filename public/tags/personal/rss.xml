                <description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago when I was in high school, my mother had a blog. She was also writing a book around that time, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I ended up being too much of a handful at that time. Well, I guess my whole family was in a down-ward spiral at that time to be honest. Anyways, I&#x27;m here now and maybe if I actually write I&#x27;ll feel less stressed, or lost...or something. I&#x27;m blessed though, I have an incredible girlfriend who I truely don&#x27;t feel like I deserve, a world-class boss who took me under his wing, and helped me become succcessful, and my loving family down south. These are the things I always need to remember; to keep myself humble and grateful, instead of depressed and confused. It&#x27;s a complicated balance, I&#x27;ll admit, but truely I&#x27;m blessed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
