    <p>Years ago when I was in high school, my mother had a blog. She was also writing a book around that time, but I'm pretty sure I ended up being too much of a handful at that time. Well, I guess my whole family was in a down-ward spiral at that time to be honest. Anyways, I'm here now and maybe if I actually write I'll feel less stressed, or lost...or something. I'm blessed though, I have an incredible girlfriend who I truely don't feel like I deserve, a world-class boss who took me under his wing, and helped me become succcessful, and my loving family down south. These are the things I always need to remember; to keep myself humble and grateful, instead of depressed and confused. It's a complicated balance, I'll admit, but truely I'm blessed.</p>
